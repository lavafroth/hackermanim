# hackermanim
Manim but for hackers.

### Getting Started

Assuming you have manim installed, run the following pip command to install hackermanim from the latest commit.
Since my femtoframework is unstable, I'm only providing installation for the latest commits using Git. The package
will be uploaded to PyPI once we have a stable release.

```sh
pip install -U git+https://github.com/lavafroth/hackermanim
```

Check out the examples under the [`examples/`](examples) directory.
